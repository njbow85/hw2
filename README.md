When an email is sent from the host it goes through a SMTP( simple mail transfer protocol). The SMTP figures out where to send the mail.  The SMTP contacts a DNS (domain name server) which is like a phone book, it is the database. The DNS keeps MX (mail exchange record) records.  The MX records help decide the email should be sent.  The DNS translates the domain into an actual address, the IP address. The message is sent the recipient’s server. This is called an MTA (mail transfer agent) it decides where to store the mail and makes it available for the recipient to access.
